This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Introduction

We are going to initialize Tailwind CSS inside our Next.js application.Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework designed to enable users to create applications faster and easier. You can use utility classes to control the layout, color, spacing, typography, shadows, and more to create a completely custom component design — without leaving your HTML or writing a single line of custom CSS.

## Running/Usage instruction

We can run the application with :

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
