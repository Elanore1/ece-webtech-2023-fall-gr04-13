# Blogging application - ECE Webtech project

## Introduction

This is a blogging application for Webtech course at ECE Paris. You can read the available articles, log in to write your own articles and share your ideas on current fashion, clothing or trends.
We use the JavaScript runtime Node.js for server-side scripting with the package manager NPM. We create a Next.js application to use React inside. To style our application, we use the Framework TailwindCSS. We use the database supabase available online and deploy our app on Vercel.

## Pre-requisites

- Javascript
- GIT [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 
- NPM package manager
- Next.js
> Install [`npx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) if it is not yet installed.
- Node.js
>Install Node.js with n-install:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential git curl
curl -L https://git.io/n-install | bash
```

## Usage

- Clone this repository, from your local machine :

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Elanore1/ece-webtech-2023-fall-gr04-13.git
  ```

-   Install all dependencies (use yarn or npm):

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- Run/Build the application :

  ```bash
  #npm run build
  npm run dev
  ```

- Register your GitHub application, get the `clientID` and `clientSecret` from GitHub and report them to your environment variable on Vercel (or on local). Set up 

Vercel env: 
  GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
  GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GITHUB_SECRET=
